["ENGLAND. Here is how the Morning Post announces the adjournment of Mr. Gladstone's financial statement: We are asked to announce that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been bedridden since Friday's cabinet meeting. Under these circumstances, his doctor felt it necessary to advise him not to take care of business for a day or two; but on Thursday or Friday, Mr. Gladstone hopes to be able to present his financial statement to the House of Commons.", "The Honourable Mr de Boe has spoken to you about what is being done in France, about the excellence of the courses, which are very well attended and which are not subject to examination. I am not afraid to say that in a few years the certificate courses will be the best given and will have the most appeal. In addition, the test is still too short for us to judge the results. If we were to appreciate them now, I would prove that the system has already produced much of the results expected of it."]
